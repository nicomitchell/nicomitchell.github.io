I was born in New York City, NY and grew up in Louisville, KY. Right now I am working remotely on my second SAP Next Talent Rotation on a microservice testing framework. I graduated in May 2020 from the University of Louisville with a BS in Computer Science and Engineering. 

I like contributing to open source projects in my free time. My favorite programming language is Go, but I've worked in C, C++, Python, and Java as well.

In my free time I like to rock climb, go to the gym, play video games, play the guitar, and learn languages. Right now I speak English, Spanish, and Portuguese (BR).
